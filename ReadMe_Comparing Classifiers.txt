# Classifier Performance Comparison

This repository contains the code and data for the practical application assignment focused on comparing the performance of different classifiers: k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines. The analysis is conducted on a dataset related to the marketing of bank products over the telephone.

## Overview

In this assignment, we aim to assess and compare the effectiveness of various machine learning classifiers in predicting the outcomes of marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese banking institution. The primary goal is to identify the most suitable classifier for this specific task based on performance metrics and analysis of the dataset.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It comprises the results of multiple marketing campaigns conducted by the bank, including various attributes such as customer demographics, campaign details, and the outcome of the marketing call. Detailed information about the dataset and its features can be found in the accompanying article included in the repository.

## Deliverables

The main deliverables for this project include:

- **Jupyter Notebook**: The jupyter notebook "Comparing Classifiers.ipynb" contains the code for data preprocessing, model building, and performance evaluation of the classifiers. The notebook also includes detailed explanations, visualizations, and interpretations of the results.

- **README.md**: Provides an overview of the project, including the problem statement, data description, and instructions for running the code. It also includes references to relevant resources and articles for further reading.

## Instructions

To replicate the analysis or explore the code further, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook (Classifier_Performance_Comparison.ipynb) to view the code and results.
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the analysis and visualize the results.
5. Feel free to modify the code or experiment with different classifiers or hyperparameters as desired.
